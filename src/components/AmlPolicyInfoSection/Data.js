    "In terms of law, money laundering means legalizing the proceeds of crime, i.e. actions that conceal the source of funds to make their nature lawful. Anti-money laundering (AML) incorporates a complex of measures to prevent the use of the country's financial system or any specific financial institution for money laundering or terrorist financing. Such measures and instruments are worked out and implemented by international and national institutions, banking and business community. That is why national and international laws make it illegal for Everpay and its employees to be knowingly or recklessly engaged in any activity related to such illegally gained capital.",
